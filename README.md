*project description
A book tracking app that allows you to search for books and add them to three different shelves (currently reading,want to read,read)

*planning for the project
1-break every view into a hierarchy of components
2-I started by separating the small components
   *opensearch, bookshelfchanger, book, bookshelf, content
   *closesearch, searchinput, searchbookbar, searchbookresult, searchbooks
3-detemine data for each component
4-after deciding the props I began to add them from up to down(parent component to child component)& set the main states
5-then I added the required methods
6-I checked everything to make sure they work properly
7-I separated components to simplify the code

*lanching the app
inside the teminal in the code editor I used the following commands in the same order
1-npm init
2-npm install --global yarn
3-npm install -g create-react-app
4-yarn add react-router-dom
5-npm install throttle-debounce
6-yarn add react-scripts
7-yarn start
 the project automatically opened in rhe web browser using a local host
